   ** Warning ** CalcDoe2DXCoil: Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed "WEST DX COOLING COIL" - Full load outlet air dry-bulb temperature < 2C. This indicates the possibility of coil frost/freeze. Outlet temperature = 0.56 C.
   **   ~~~   **  ...Occurrence info = RUNPERIOD 1, 04/16 08:02 - 08:04
   **   ~~~   ** ... Possible reasons for low outlet air dry-bulb temperatures are: This DX coil
   **   ~~~   **    1) may have a low inlet air dry-bulb temperature. Inlet air temperature = 12.929 C.
   **   ~~~   **    2) may have a low air flow rate per watt of cooling capacity. Check inputs.
   **   ~~~   **    3) is used as part of a HX assisted cooling coil which uses a high sensible effectiveness. Check inputs.
   ** Warning ** CalcDoe2DXCoil: Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed="WEST DX COOLING COIL" - Air volume flow rate per watt of rated total cooling capacity is out of range at 2.573E-005 m3/s/W.
