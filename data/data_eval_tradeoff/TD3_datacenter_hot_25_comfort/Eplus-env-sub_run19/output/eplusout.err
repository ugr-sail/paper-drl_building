   ** Warning ** CoolingTower:VariableSpeed "COOLING TOWER" - Tower range temperature is outside model boundaries at 5.44E-003.
   **   ~~~   **  ...Valid range = 1.11 to 22.22. Occurrence info = RUNPERIOD 1, 01/01 00:18 - 00:20
   **   ~~~   **  ...Tower range temperature passed to the model = 5.43749E-003
   **   ~~~   **  ...Range temperatures outside model boundaries may not adversely affect tower performance.
   **   ~~~   **  ...This is not an unexpected occurrence when simulating actual conditions.
   ** Warning ** CalcDoe2DXCoil: Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed "WEST DX COOLING COIL" - Full load outlet air dry-bulb temperature < 2C. This indicates the possibility of coil frost/freeze. Outlet temperature = -5.55 C.
   **   ~~~   **  ...Occurrence info = RUNPERIOD 1, 01/01 12:30 - 12:45
   **   ~~~   ** ... Possible reasons for low outlet air dry-bulb temperatures are: This DX coil
   **   ~~~   **    1) may have a low inlet air dry-bulb temperature. Inlet air temperature = 13.839 C.
   **   ~~~   **    2) may have a low air flow rate per watt of cooling capacity. Check inputs.
   **   ~~~   **    3) is used as part of a HX assisted cooling coil which uses a high sensible effectiveness. Check inputs.
   ** Warning ** CoolingTower:VariableSpeed "COOLING TOWER" - Tower approach temperature is outside model boundaries at 0.99.
   **   ~~~   **  ...Valid range = 1.11 to 40.00. Occurrence info = RUNPERIOD 1, 01/04 11:15 - 11:30
