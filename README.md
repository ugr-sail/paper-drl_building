# An experimental evaluation of Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms for HVAC control

Supplementary material to the paper. Includes datasets, charts and additional code.

The experiments were conducted using [Sinergym](https://github.com/ugr-sail/sinergym), a framework for building energy simulation.

## 📖 Abstract

The building and construction sector, and in particular heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, pose a major impact on global energy consumption and CO$_2$ emissions. In search of improving their efficient control, recent studies have addressed this problem by employing different deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms. However, most of the DRL solutions proposed in the literature are explicitly designed for specific problems, and do not provide a standardized overview of the DRL alternatives available. The aim of this paper is to fill this gap by providing a detailed performance evaluation of DRL algorithms in a varied set of building environments and configurations. To this end, Sinergym framework was used, approaching the comparison of algorithms from the perspectives of consumption and comfort, and taking into account the performance of agents, their robustness in different environments, the application of curriculum learning techniques, as well as the trade-off between comfort and consumption requirements. The results offer promising results for SAC and TD3 compared to reactive control methods, as well as relevant insights into their generalization and learning capabilities.
