Supplementary material to the paper. Includes datasets, charts and additional code.

The experiments were conducted using [Sinergym](https://github.com/ugr-sail/sinergym), a framework for building energy simulation.

## 📖 Abstract

Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are a major driver of energy consumption in commercial and residential buildings. Recent studies have shown that Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms can outperform traditional reactive controllers. However, DRL-based solutions are generally designed for ad hoc setups and lack standardization for comparison. To fill this gap, this paper provides a critical and reproducible evaluation, in terms of comfort and energy consumption, of several state-of-the-art DRL algorithms for HVAC control. The study examines the controllers’ robustness, adaptability, and trade-off between optimization goals by using the [Sinergym](https://github.com/ugr-sail/sinergym) framework. The results obtained confirm the potential of DRL algorithms, such as SAC and TD3, in complex scenarios and reveal several challenges related to generalization and incremental learning.
